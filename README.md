## 🎓 About Me

I'm a **junior student** majoring in **Computer Science and Technology** at **Zhejiang University** (浙江大学). I'm passionate about creating practical solutions to everyday problems, especially when it involves automating the boring stuff! 🚀

### 🛠️ What I Do

- 💡 **Tinkering with Tools**: I love building small utilities that make life easier. One of my favorites? An automated questionnaire-filling script – because who has time to manually fill out repetitive forms? 😉
- 📚 **Sharing Knowledge**: I regularly upload my course notes and study materials to help fellow students and anyone interested in learning
- 🌱 **Currently Learning**: Diving deep into **MkDocs** configuration to create beautiful documentation sites

## 💻 Tech Stack

```python
class Miracle:
    def __init__(self):
        self.languages = ["Python", "C", "C++", "Java"]
        self.skill_level = "somewhat_rusty"  # Haven't used some in a while 😅
        self.status = "perpetually_learning"
        
    def introduce(self):
        return "A slightly unreliable coder who occasionally forgets syntax but never stops building!"
```

**Languages I've worked with** (though I'll admit, I've forgotten more than I'd like to admit 😂):
- 🐍 **Python** - My go-to for automation and scripting
- 🔧 **C/C++** - For when I need to get close to the metal
- ☕ **Java** - Object-oriented adventures

> *Disclaimer: I'm a somewhat unreliable programmer – I might have forgotten half of what I learned, but Google and Stack Overflow are my best friends!* 😄
